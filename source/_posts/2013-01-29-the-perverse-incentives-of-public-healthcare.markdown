I see many [smart, thoughtful, well-meaning people](http://www.undeniableruth.com/2013/01/29/my-thoughts-on-the-american-health-care-problem/comment-page-1/#comment-86789)
that are unaware of the overwhelming evidence
that increasing general health actually **increases** health care costs.
This is especially true for reductions in partially-preventable chronic disease,
which have the most dramatic affect on lifespan.
Reducing smoking and obesity will actually make the fiscal situations *worse*
for the citizens in countries that have chosen to
publicly share/bare health care costs.
For countries who disproportionately share the cost of elderly care,
such as the US,
this affect is only amplified.

Focusing efforts on improving healthy is a noble goal,
but the evidence is very clear that healthy people spend *more* on health care.
The longer you live,
and especially the longer you live at advanced age,
the more your total medical costs increase (on average).
In the US,
under both the previous and ACA-modified regulatory/legal regimes,
the conversation centers around controlling costs.
Perversely,
the best thing a person can do for their lifetime healthcare cost
is to die young of preventable diseases.

Some references to that affect:

## People with chronic diseases are cheaper
For 65-yo couples, the mean and 5% expected expenses for:
* No chronic disease: $260k and $570k
* With chronic disease: $220k and $465k

## People that live longer cost more

## For lifetime healthcare costs: Healthy people > obese people > smokers

Based on currently-available information,
I see no hope for reducing costs by increasing health.
It’s actually counter-productive.

To me,
the measurement of a health care regulatory/legal regime is not cost,
but medical outcomes (which are dominated by technology improvements)
and by individual choice.
People matter.
It’s a perverse game to judge a system by cost
or surface things like patient satisfaction,
but that’s what our previous system brought.
The ACA seems set to only accelerates those trends.

Few would want to live in a world where food ownership was controlled federally and we debated over how to ration food in order to properly optimize everyone’s nutrition, but somehow well-meaning folks see health insurance differently. The only substantive difference is that healthcare costs are not predictable and evenly-distributed like food costs. That’s why I’d prefer the simplest-possible universal catastrophic coverage system to eliminate that difference and make it clear that economics and incentives apply equally to ribeye steaks, hydroponic vegetables, annual physicals and cardiac bypass surgery.
