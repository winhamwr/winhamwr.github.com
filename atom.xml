    <title>How dotCloud Is Demonitizing PaaS With Docker</title>
    <link href="http://winhamwr.github.com/blog/2013/08/14/how-dotcloud-is-demonitizing-paas-with-docker/"/>

    <id>http://winhamwr.github.com/blog/2013/08/14/how-dotcloud-is-demonitizing-paas-with-docker</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyway,
it finally clicked for me
that lightweight containerization is the missing piece in my plans
for an open source deployment tool to &amp;#8220;demonitize&amp;#8221; the current crop
of &amp;#8220;git push heroku&amp;#8221; PaaS  providers.
&lt;em&gt;evil pinkie finger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems are solved or very solvable with current tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Solved (or mostly-solved) problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Application Builders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools to package up your &amp;#8220;application&amp;#8221;
(rails, node.js, python, Java, etc)
with all of it&amp;#8217;s dependencies
and define a clear way to run that application.
All of the things that wrap around
language-specific dependency management tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bundler.io/&quot;&gt;bundler&lt;/a&gt; with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://rvm.io/&quot;&gt;rvm&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv&quot;&gt;rbenv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualenv.org/&quot;&gt;virtualenv&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PolicyStat/terrarium&quot;&gt;terrarium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://npmjs.org/&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_file_format_(Sun&quot;&gt;Java WAR files&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Current Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks&quot;&gt;Heroku Buildpacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/progrium/buildstep&quot;&gt;buildstep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Configuration Management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the level above application builds
and good config management will use an application builder as well.
Defining things like what should be installed on a machine
(packages)
and what their config files should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Current Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chef&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puppet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saltstack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Orchestration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the level above Configuration Management,
which defines how chunks of config management should work together
&lt;strong&gt;in motion&lt;/strong&gt;.
It strings together different components,
eg some web server processes,
memcached instances,
some background job workers
and a database.
Some of these even help you spread your services across pre-existing hardware
without you needing to make decisions
(provisioning across a &amp;#8220;cluster&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Current Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Juju&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Shift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Flynn (discussed below) does this job,
but also aims higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these tools consider themselves,
or at least market themselves,
as a PaaS in a box.
Most provide at least some of the &amp;#8220;Heroku experience&amp;#8221; for developers,
but currently have fairly fundamental flaws
that severely limit their potential
to disrupt the current status quo.
But that&amp;#8217;s a large topic in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;^1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Do it in the cloud: Infrastructure (as a service)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece is optional,
and largely orthogonal to the other needs,
but is something that almost everyone could use.
You can stop here if you just want to run your application in a colo
with a fixed number of servers.
That makes sense for very few people though,
and makes high availability
and load-aware scaling much more expensive and/or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus,
even my mom knows that &amp;#8220;The Cloud&amp;#8221; is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Current Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Compute Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rackspace Cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other folks trying to provide public &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstack.org/&quot;&gt;Open Stack&lt;/a&gt; clouds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Not (yet) solved problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;One-step, Production-aware Deploys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;code&gt;$ git push heroku&lt;/code&gt; part.
A developer runs one command
and all of those other pieces in the stack dance as appropriate
so that your application changes
without your users noticing.
You&amp;#8217;ll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Key Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load-balancer juggling for zero-downtime deploys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated health checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rollbacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backing services managed automatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling up and down via one bullet-proof command (or API)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy application High Availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy ops &amp;#8220;Best Practices&amp;#8221;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring/Alerting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log Aggregation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service Registration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The proprietary PaaS providers use this as their respective secret sauces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Requirements that Can Be Met&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staged deploys enforcing HA requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datacenter awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to optimize hardware usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dev can implement backing services
using open source recipes
with close to the Heroku services experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ops can create backing services
with their familiar tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed backing services
with persistent disk support
and integrated backup/restore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Emerging solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Dokku&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/progrium/dokku&quot;&gt;Dokku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker powered mini-Heroku.
This is a toy-ish proof of concept powered by Docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Flynn&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flynn.io/&quot;&gt;Flynn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$80k+ in funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staffed by super-smart people
(including the author of Dokku)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aiming to be the thing that
the Orchestration tools should have been.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not aiming at solving the infrastructure provisioning problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h5&gt;Neckbeard&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/winhamwr/neckbeard&quot;&gt;Neckbeard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My project that really doesn&amp;#8217;t deserve to be mentioned in the same category,
but is the open-sourcing
of an internal tool
that solves the problems Flynn aims to solve.
With the announcement of Flynn,
I&amp;#8217;d be very,
very happy
to rewrite Neckbeard as something powered by Flynn.
From my reading of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/flynn/flynn-spec&quot;&gt;Flynn Spec&lt;/a&gt;,
I would still need:
* IaaS helpers:
  Automatically provision ec2 instances,
  mount EBS volumes
* Datacenter-aware HA:
  Don&amp;#8217;t put the whole service in one Availability Zone
* Use the Flynn API to implement staged rollouts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Configuration Management and Orchestration still sucks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with Chef/Puppet/Saltstack
and the proliferation of open source,
reusable code
(eg. Chef Cookbooks)
based around things like
MySQL,
Memcached,
and Nginx,
there&amp;#8217;s still no such thing as
an off-the-shelve MySQL high-availability setup.
There&amp;#8217;s no
&amp;#8220;Here&amp;#8217;s how you configure Redis to survive losing a datacenter
with no interruption or data loss.&amp;#8221;
There&amp;#8217;s no
&amp;#8220;run this command to add another memcached node.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;^2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more difficult,
try mixing and matching these various services
on machines that aren&amp;#8217;t dedicated to that purpose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku and other PaaS providers punt on this problem
by letting companies sell you &lt;a href=&quot;http://12factor.net/backing-services&quot;&gt;Backing Services&lt;/a&gt;
that do the hard stuff
which you can consume over APIs.
That&amp;#8217;s a great business move
as long as there are no alternatives for people other than
&amp;#8220;either hire someone really smart
who knows how to make MySQL high-availability her bitch,
or spend a couple years learning about it in production.&amp;#8221;
Pay an X% markup over infrastructure price
(plus a chunk to Heroku)
 to not need to worry about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hells yeah I will!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enter Docker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Docker comes in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s difficult and time-consuming
to learn MySQL well enough to do an awesome HA setup,
but that knowledge is easily shared
if someone else needs an identical setup.
The problem is that no setups are identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#8217;re all Unique Snowflakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs to customize things to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep service A from breaking service B
before they even start.
&amp;#8220;Shit.
My Redis package upgrades a library that mysql uses.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep service A from breaking service B occasionally in production.
&amp;#8220;Balls.
A uwsgi process hit 400MB in a request
and RabbitMQ ran out of memory and crashed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep services X and Y working together after Y fails over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restore service Y with backed up data
and make service X aware of the change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;You&amp;#8217;re not Special&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker,
via &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC&quot;&gt;Linux Containers&lt;/a&gt;,
 allows complete isolation
so that everyone&amp;#8217;s service X looks the same.
It does this with requiring heavy virtualization,
so you can actually use it outside of development.
This means that your Chef Cookbook
(or whatever configuration management slash orchestration tool)
only needs care about a limited set of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service A and B are isolated.
You can&amp;#8217;t put yourself in dependency hell.
No more coordinating users,
groups
and permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can place strict boxes around resources
so that service A can&amp;#8217;t
hog all of service B&amp;#8217;s RAM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(and 4)
Since the services are in containers,
I can use any container-aware config management recipes
and be sure they work in my environment.
Even better,
I can test the failure modes on my laptop
or in a Vagrant config
running on my laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Existing Tools + Docker + ??? = Awesome&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Docker is a thing,
the last ingredient towards
The Solution exists.
Flynn,
or whatever wins in the FOSS marketplace of ideas,
can string together Docker plus the myriad existing FOSS tools
and build a whole that is much greater than the sum of its parts.
This kind of tool has several huge advantages
over any potential commercial PaaS
or multi-project Enterprise PaaS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A FOSS,
single-entity PaaS
based on Docker plus existing tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a focused scope.
When scope is smaller,
it&amp;#8217;s easier to deliver a great result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will encourage more free contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can leverage more existing and continued work
from established communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are overwhelming advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advantage: Focused Scope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of PaaS providers
with a lot of dedicated development resources.
Heroku and dotCloud in particular
have some amazing developers who do amazing work.
Docker wouldn&amp;#8217;t even exist
if dotCloud hadn&amp;#8217;t developed and open-sourced it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these companies and projects
are solving much more than just the deployment/operations problem.
In order to maintain superiority,
and holding quality constant,
a software project needs either faster development
or smaller scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Commercial and Enterprise PaaS Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run a commercial PaaS like Heroku and dotCloud
or a segmented,
multi-user Enterprise Pass,
you must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a service to allow one-command deployment
and management of one application
across one or more containers
on one or more servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operate that service in production with customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and operate a control plane
to separate multiple apps from the same customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and operate a service
to control provisioning IaaS resources
and balance those needs against
the API requests of many customers
with many separate apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and operate a customer-facing web interface
across the whole system
to give customers app-level insight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and operate an API service
to allow partners
to register and sell services
to their customers,
along with interfaces for those customers
to use those services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and operate managed services for things like
production databases and Memcached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;^3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Single-Project PaaS Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a service to allow one-command deployment
and management of one application
across one or more containers
on one or more servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Advantage: More Free Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of contribution across various existing tools actually varied quite widely.
In a broad sense,
it&amp;#8217;s expected that FOSS projects will receive more contribution,
but that&amp;#8217;s not necessarily the case.
It&amp;#8217;s very possible to structure a FOSS project
such that outside contribution is difficult and rare.
It&amp;#8217;s also possible for commercial companies to benefit from
(and contribute to)
open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that a FOSS project with a focused scope
and thus lower barrier to contribution
has much higher potential for contribution.
It&amp;#8217;s also clear that even if some portion of building blocks are open source,
proprietary software does not have the same potential for contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to the current state of PaaS options,
no option is widely benefiting from open contribution.
With the goal of rebuilding dotCloud on top of Docker,
dotCloud does appear to be poised to take most advantage,
however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Proprietary: Heroku&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without performing deep analysis,
it appears that all current Github projects
under the Heroku organization
are overwhelmingly driven by Heroku employees.
Many have dozens of minor community contributions,
though,
which certainly helps.
It&amp;#8217;s also not clear if
any of the current Heroku employees contributed heavily
to those projects
before becoming Heroku employees.
That should certainly count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Proprietary: dotCloud&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we examine dotCloud&amp;#8217;s receipt of open contribution
before the release of Docker,
it looks very similar to Heroku.
Many projects have dozens of contributions,
but they&amp;#8217;re all very small.
These are valuable,
but are not hugely significant
compared to the contribution of full-time staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the Docker project is a similar story,
but at a different scope.
It has largely been led
by 4 or 5 current or former dotCloud employees,
but in it&amp;#8217;s short existence
has received contribution
from over 100 outside committers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;OS: Open Shift&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Open Shift project appears to be open source with a one-way valve.
While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openshift/origin-server&quot;&gt;origin-server&lt;/a&gt; source code
is available,
I was unable to locate a single contributor
who didn&amp;#8217;t appear to be a Red Hat employee.
This is effectively open source as advertising
and Open Shift shouldn&amp;#8217;t be evaluated
as if a growing community would accelerate its improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;OS: Cloud Foundry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Cloud Foundry,
Open Shift mostly drops the &amp;#8220;Free to improve&amp;#8221; section of FOSS.
They have at least made some effort to encourage contribution,
and do appear willing to accept it.
I was able to find at least a few very minor contributors
to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release&quot;&gt;cf-release&lt;/a&gt;
who at least didn&amp;#8217;t appear to be commercially associated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advantage: Existing Communities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of a core that is more-focused
and much greater potential for shared contribution to that core,
a single-tenant FOSS PaaS based on existing tools
can re-use a lot of existing work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking just at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?q=chef&quot;&gt;Chef-related&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?q=puppet&quot;&gt;Puppet-related&lt;/a&gt;
projects on Github
reveals thousands of projects
with thousands of developers able to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroku does boast nearly 100 &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Add-ons&lt;/a&gt;,
this number pairs on comparison.
Further,
there&amp;#8217;s no reason our envisioned FOSS PaaS
couldn&amp;#8217;t use every single one of those add-ons,
perhaps with a bit less slick sign-up process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: I reserve the right to be completely wrong about Cloud Foundry.
They&amp;#8217;re at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite&quot;&gt;experimenting&lt;/a&gt;
with Docker for the tool that deploys Cloud Foundry.
I might just not be smart enough
to &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/bosh/components/&quot;&gt;understand Cloud Foundry&lt;/a&gt;.
Heck,
I don&amp;#8217;t really even understand
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh&quot;&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt; they wrote
to deploy Cloud Foundry itself!?
I&amp;#8217;m told by someone I trust who kind of understands it
that the architecture is really cool.
It also looks like basically everything
is undergoing a major V2/NG rewrite,
so maybe they&amp;#8217;ll get more hackable,
more composable,
and more ops-friendly
before Flynn does it&amp;#8217;s thing.
I hope it happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: Orchestration tools like Juju aim to provide this
with hooks to define and consume services
and hooks to handle change events
but that only gives you a framework
to solve the problem yourself.
Even with example Juju charms,
for example,
you have the same problem as with &amp;#8220;reusable&amp;#8221; Chef Cookbooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3: Theoretically,
you don&amp;#8217;t need to operate a FOSS Enterprise PaaS
in order to build it,
but both Open Shift
and Cloud Foundry do operate paid versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Perverse Incentives of Public Health Care</title>
    <link href="http://winhamwr.github.com/blog/2013/01/29/the-perverse-incentives-of-public-healthcare/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-29T19:27:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://winhamwr.github.com/blog/2013/01/29/the-perverse-incentives-of-public-healthcare</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I see many &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.undeniableruth.com/2013/01/29/my-thoughts-on-the-american-health-care-problem/comment-page-1/#comment-86789&quot;&gt;smart, thoughtful, well-meaning people&lt;/a&gt;
that are unaware of the overwhelming evidence
that increasing general health actually &lt;strong&gt;increases&lt;/strong&gt; health care costs.
This is especially true for reductions in partially-preventable chronic disease,
which have the most dramatic affect on lifespan.
Reducing smoking and obesity will actually make the fiscal situations &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;
for the citizens in countries that have chosen to
publicly share/bare health care costs.
For countries who disproportionately share the cost of elderly care,
such as the US,
this affect is only amplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing efforts on improving healthy is a noble goal,
but the evidence is very clear that healthy people spend &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; on health care.
The longer you live,
and especially the longer you live at advanced age,
the more your total medical costs increase (on average).
In the US,
under both the previous and ACA-modified regulatory/legal regimes,
the conversation centers around controlling costs.
Perversely,
the best thing a person can do for their lifetime healthcare cost
is to die young of preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some references to that affect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;People with chronic diseases are cheaper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 65-yo couples, the mean and 5% expected expenses for:
* No chronic disease: $260k and $570k
* With chronic disease: $220k and $465k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IB_10-8.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;People that live longer cost more&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;For lifetime healthcare costs: Healthy people &gt; obese people &gt; smokers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on currently-available information,
I see no hope for reducing costs by increasing health.
It’s actually counter-productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me,
the measurement of a health care regulatory/legal regime is not cost,
but medical outcomes (which are dominated by technology improvements)
and by individual choice.
People matter.
It’s a perverse game to judge a system by cost
or surface things like patient satisfaction,
but that’s what our previous system brought.
The ACA seems set to only accelerates those trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few would want to live in a world where food ownership was controlled federally and we debated over how to ration food in order to properly optimize everyone’s nutrition, but somehow well-meaning folks see health insurance differently. The only substantive difference is that healthcare costs are not predictable and evenly-distributed like food costs. That’s why I’d prefer the simplest-possible universal catastrophic coverage system to eliminate that difference and make it clear that economics and incentives apply equally to ribeye steaks, hydroponic vegetables, annual physicals and cardiac bypass surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
