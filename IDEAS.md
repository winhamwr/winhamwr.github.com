## Wages of Wins for movies

* actors, directors, screen writers, producers, EP, studio

## Summary of the Case For Mars plan

## Getting started on Paleo with lots of resources

## WP90 for soccer

P = avg number of passes leading to a shot
K = probability that SoG scores
How stable are P and K across leagues/years/teams?

* Tackles (plus)
* Turnovers (minus)
* cards (minus)
* offsides (minus)
* Fouls within some distance of the goal? (minus)
* Fouls suffered (plus)
* Shots on Goal (plus)
* Shots not on goal (minus)
* Passes that result in a shot (plus). How to distribute the credit?
* How do you factor out things that coaches decide like who takes corners/PKs/FKs? Maybe negative for turnovers and shots off frame account for this?

What about for keepers? (separate problem)
